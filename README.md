# X-Ray

## To do
- [x] Download full list of packages daily & use that for search
  - Stream download from npm since it's a large JSON file
- [ ] Cache responses from registry
- [ ] Write more tests
- [ ] Implement diff
- [ ] Add cronjob to clear tmp regularly
- [ ] Add S3 storage
- [ ] Put cursor in search field immediately when viewing page
- [ ] Maybe: support from doing directly to diff from lockfile diff
